# CSE 100: Advanced Data Structures Assignment 1

Project Overview: The goal of this assignment is to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) from scratch. The BST has the ability to: 

	- find(): find an element
	- size(): returns total number of elements
	- deleteAll(): deletes all the elements
	- empty(): checks if the BST is empty
	- successor(): returns the next element in an in-order traversal
	- insert(): insert a node into the BST
	- height(): return the height of the BST
	- begin(): return an iterator pointing to the first item in the BST (not the root)
	- end(): return an iterator pointing to the last item in the BST
	- inorder(): perform an in-order traversal of the BST
	- first(): find the first element of the BST
